# TransSite
predicting the change in protein transport-sequence activity upon the presence of genetic variations. (beta)

The presence of single residue mutations in the protein localisation peptides have not discussed or analysed at length. We have created a python code, 

that take into account the change in the biochemical properties (including charge), molecular weight and isoelectric pointm the factors most important

in the protien transportation, and provide a collective change value in these parameters in a simple yet effective way. 

PS: the code is in its beta version.

# How To:

its a commandline tools:

python aaCharge.py <peptide sequence>
